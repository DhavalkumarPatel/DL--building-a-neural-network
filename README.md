This notebook aims to build an image classification model using a logistic neural network (manually). 

Points to keep in mind while working with an image dataset:
1. MLP based neural network require the sample to be a vector. Hence, reshaping is essential. 
2. Standardization (i.e., dividing the vector by 255 to scale the values from [0,1])

Essential building blocks and learnings for a neural network:
1. Parameter Initialization
2. Cost Function Calculation
3. Gradient Calculation and Updates
4. Exploration of Learning rates
    
Note: This elements of this notebook were completed as part of my Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
